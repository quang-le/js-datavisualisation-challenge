1. Introduction
* Challenge objectives: 
    - DOM manipulation
    - AJAX requests
    - Use of 3rd party libraries (in this case d3/Dimple)
    - Problem-solving
    - Debugging using the console
    - Understand prioritizing

* The challenge:
Before the end of the week:
    - Insert 2 interactive graphic representations of html tables (file provided)
    - Insert a table using data fetched through an AJAx request with an update every second.

2. Planning ()
* Determine benchmark for either task (minimum to achieve and best case result)
* Code the AJAX request, with minimum formatting
* Find place in the DOM to insert the graphs
* If possible at this stage, make basic DOM insertion
* Choose between Dimple and D3
* Learn to use the library
* Create branch for low-tier result
* Implement low-tier result
* If time allows it: repeat with high-tier result.

3. Implementation
