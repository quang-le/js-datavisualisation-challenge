**Challenge Javascript Solo: Datavisualisation**
*created by quang-le on 09/07/2018*
*Last update 09/07/2018*


1. Introduction
* Challenge objectives: 
    - DOM manipulation
    - AJAX requests
    - Use of 3rd party libraries (in this case d3/Dimple)
    - Problem-solving
    - Debugging using the console
    - Understand prioritizing

* The challenge:
Before the end of the week:
    - Insert 2 interactive graphic representations of html tables (file provided)
    - Insert a table using data fetched through an AJAx request with an update every second.

2. Planning
* Determine benchmark for either task (minimum to achieve and best case result) - OK 09/07/2018, 10:47
* Code the AJAX request, with minimum formatting - Done 09/07/2018, 11:00. Server problem pending coach's side.
* Find place in the DOM to insert the graphs - OK 09/07/2018, 09:30 (during review)
* If possible at this stage, make basic DOM insertion - OK 09/07/2018, 11:50: inserted text. 
* Choose between Dimple and D3 
* Learn to use the library
* Create branch for low-tier result
* Implement low-tier result
* If time allows it: repeat with high-tier result.


3. Determine 2 tiers of expected results

X. Log 
09/07/2018: 
- create AJAX request: html error 0. Request blocked server side. Leave it a that for now. The script seems to work properly though. Error identification process: console logged the request lauching, then an error message, then the other steps of the request (reached state 4, then failed then logged html error 0)
- 14:00: put the page on github page as the console logged many errors saying http or https protocol was required. Moving the stable version of the project to the dev branch.
- 14:30: manage to change inner HTML at the right place but dimple doesn't seem to work as intended; Then again I just copied and pasted the example. Time to dive deeper in the library. 
- 15:00: checked the AJAX request with the new url provided.It works.
- 15:30: figured out the example used a .tsv file but an array of object could be used instead
- 16:30: installed jQuery and used selectors to find a (legible) way to target the data to be looped through
- 17:30: fixed the loop that creates the array containing the data in the html
- 17:35: Dimple seems to create the same problems as working with a css template. Might as well work directly in d3. 
- 18:20: made the graph work with Dimple. The data in html needed to be modified, so that the comma in the numbers is replaced by a dot, in order to be able to `parseFloat` the data. Remaining bugs: no grapgh generated for countries with incomplete data sets (France, Ireland), need to crop the names of countries with footnote reference (eg: Turkey). Also: a readable unit scale is needed for y-axis.

10/07/2018:
- 12:00: read d3 tutorials. Feeling ready to try something out.
- 12:05: merged dimple graphs on master. Created d3 branch
- 17:00: somehow all changes were carried on to master. Couldn't make enough sense od D3 documantation

11/07/2018:
- 10:30: found good resource online. 
- 14:00: finished reading online book about D3
- 14:30: start reviewing planned graph, switching to bar graph, with a twist TBD.
- 15:30: start coding new bar graph

12/07/2018:
- 11:00: the screen displays black bars. Struggling with axes.
- 15:30: manage to display country names on y axis. bars are colored and separated now. X-axis is displayed but the scale is not correct
- 17:00: fixed the axes by switching to dynamic scaling. centered the country names on y-axis by using `.bandwidth` to set rectangles' y position.
- 19:30: now displaying 2 bars per country in graph 1. Had difficulty with the padding as I wanted smaller padding between bars of a same country(better legibility). Fixed it by tinkering with the y coordinate of the rectangle again.
- 20:30: added graph2, by updating graph1 code. I'm certain there's a way to make a single graph generator function, but I'm out of time for this right now. Starting the AJAX graph, then I will add the interctive twist on each graph.
- 00:00: generate a graph with an unbelievable shape and use setTimeout to add a new one. Need to add transition and to figure out domain shifting. Examples will be useful.

13/07/2018:
- 9:00-13:30: unable to do anything good. Too much stress to be able to think properly
- 14:00: after a big break and letting go of the fact that I won't be able to complete the challeng on time, Is tart working again
- 15:00: with the help of Claudiu, I manage to have a bare bones AJAX graph working.
- 16:00: added legend for graphs 1 and 2. tried to make them clickable to hide selected countries, but the modification of the y-axis and the selection of the 2 corresponding bars was to hard to figure out in the hour I have left.Âµ
- 16:00: changed the the base opacity to 0.8 for the bars, and put it on 1 on mouseover. Not pretty, but it meets the rquirement of intercativity. Now to gitHub pages!
